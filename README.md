## Huffman and DPCM Encoding-Decoding Implementation


This was the main project for the course 'Digital Communications'. <br>

In Part A i implemented huffman encoding and decoding functions. <br>

In Part B i implemented Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) encoding and decoding functions. <br>

Source_meros_a/ and Source_meros_b/ contain test source data to test our implementation. <br>

Full description of the project can be found in Askisi_18_19.pdf. <br>

Report file 5878.pdf contains detailed explanations of all the implementation steps.
